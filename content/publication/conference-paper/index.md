  Real-time global illumination is a highly desirable yet challenging task in
  computer graphics. Existing works well solving this problem are mostly based
  on some kind of precomputed data (caches), while the final results depend
  significantly on the quality of the caches.In this paper, we propose a
  learning-based pipeline that can reproduce a wide range of complex light
  transport phenomena, including high-frequency glossy interreflection, at any
  viewpoint in real time (> 90 frames per-second),using information from
  imperfect caches stored at the barycentre of every triangle in a 3D scene. The
  proposed framework ensures high-quality rendering of images for moderate-sized
  scenes with full global illumination effects, at the cost of reasonable
  precomputation time."
